# Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a security feature implemented by web browsers to prevent malicious websites from accessing resources on a different domain. It allows servers to specify who can access their resources and how those resources can be accessed.

## How CORS Works

When a web application makes a request to a different domain (cross-origin request), the browser sends an HTTP request with an `Origin` header. The server can respond with specific headers to indicate whether the request is allowed.

### Key CORS Headers

- `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`: Specifies which origins are allowed to access the resource.
- `Access-Control-Allow-Methods`: Specifies the HTTP methods that are allowed when accessing the resource.
- `Access-Control-Allow-Headers`: Specifies the headers that can be used in the actual request.
- `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials`: Indicates whether the request can include user credentials (cookies, HTTP authentication).

## Example

Here is an example of how to enable CORS in an Express.js application:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const cors = require('cors');
const app = express();

app.use(cors());

app.get('/api/data', (req, res) => {
    res.json({ message: 'This is CORS-enabled for all origins!' });
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});
```

In this example, the `cors` middleware is used to enable CORS for all routes in the Express.js application.

## Conclusion

CORS is an essential security feature for web applications that interact with resources from different origins. By properly configuring CORS headers, you can control which domains are allowed to access your resources and ensure the security of your application.
